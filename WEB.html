        <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website, "Abdul's Corner." I am Abdul Waris, currently 18 years old (at the time when I coded this website). Here, I would like to share with you my passion for web development and how it has shaped my journey so far.

            During my middle school years, I discovered my love for creating HTML webpages. I was fascinated by the ability to display GIFs that I downloaded from Google. This led me to experiment with different GIFs, creating short stories around them, and transforming them into basic websites. Although simple, I found these websites to be pretty cool, and they sparked my curiosity to explore further.
            
            As I transitioned into high school, I realized that I could make my websites even more captivating by incorporating JavaScript and CSS. However, this transition was not without its challenges. The shift from HTML to JavaScript proved to be complex, and I almost considered quitting. But my determination and passion for web development pushed me to persevere.
            
            Fast forward to the Covid-19 pandemic, which struck in 2020 and continued into 2021, bringing with it a significant change in our lives. Initially, I despised the idea of online classes. However, with an abundance of spare time on my hands, I decided to utilize it effectively. I delved into the world of software development, primarily through platforms like Codecademy, App Academy Open, and CS50.
            
            These courses became a source of inspiration and motivation for me, fueling my desire to dig deeper into the realm of software development and pursue it as a career. The pandemic served as a turning point in my life, allowing me to focus on honing my skills and broadening my knowledge in this exciting field. </p>
